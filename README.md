<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/afuentes11/recipe-page-devChallenges/blob/master/img/desktop%20screen.png)

The project consists of the creation of a responsive website for the presentation of a classic cheesecake recipe.  [The original design](https://www.figma.com/file/2jVBTSKeCYF0dIN6fi0stX?chrome=DOCUMENTATION&embed_host=astra&kind=&node-id=0%3A1&viewer=1) was provided by Devchallenges in the challenge.

The page can be viewed at the following [link](https://afuentes11.github.io/recipe-page-devChallenges/). If you liked the project, give me a star ‚≠ê.

By developing the project I got a much better understanding of each of the Flexbox properties in css, and also improved my skills in designing checkboxes interactively.
